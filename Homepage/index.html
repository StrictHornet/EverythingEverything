            Princewill is quick-witted and has exemplary analytical skills. During our multiple office hours discussions 
            where I perceived his native intelligence and quick problem-solving skills, I also discerned his divergent, 
            abstract thinking style in the field of study and beyond. His brimming passion for computer science is incredible. 
            Princewill has proven to be a leader by being an inspiration to many during his period at Covenant University. 
            As head coach, he took the Computer Science & Management Information Systems (CMIS) football team past the
            group stage after an anomalous union between both programs. Under his watch, the team got to the
            semi-finals stage. A first-time accomplishment for the football team.
            In the conversations we have shared he has extensively displayed a passion for technological
            advancement in Nigeria. He considers the integration of smart solutions a pivotal requirement for the
            development of Nigeria’s technology sector and as such, he aspires to enforce tremendous impact in the
            industry in hopes to improve the overall state of the country. He has keenly spoken with me about his
            ambitions for solving global problems and has exhibited merit understanding of the resilience required
            for radical change. I witnessed his participation in the department’s computer training outreach program
            in the rural town of Otta. In this exercise, he showed genuine compassion when relating to the
            inhabitants of the town. I am also aware he partook in an ambitious campaign with his graduating set
            where they raised a million books for disadvantaged children in poor communities around Nigeria. He
            is an exceptional student with an exceptional character. I have a great amount of trust in Princewill. He
            seldom fails to deliver what is expected of him.
